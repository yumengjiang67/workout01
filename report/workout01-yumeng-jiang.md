**We are the champion!**
------------------------

Last season, when they lost the final championship, the warriors fell from the altar. However, those warriors have naver been depressed. Last summer, they sent half of the original team in order to sign Durant in a fierce battle, thus creating a 4 that shocked the league.After that, the Golden State Warriors experienced a slow start, experienced Curry's downturn and Durant's injury, and a series of losing. But relying on a strong resilience and the intelligence of Steve Kerr, they finally cracked the dilemma, won at least 65 games in the third consecutive season, locked the regular season championship,and achieved a perfect reshap.

----------------------

2016-2017 may be one of the most glorious moment of Golden State Warriors,the top stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant became a most worthy player of NBA history. However, if we just look at the effeciency of shooting, maybe other players also have excellent performance.

Before we start analysing the shooting effeciency, let's have a look at the shooting position habit of each player. How long are the their best shooting distances? and where can they get most points?

*Andre Iguodala* Iguodala is familiar with the left part of the court,where he made most of his shooting attempt and get the points. He also like to shoot near the 3 point line and near the basket.

### **Total shooting efficiency**

Then let's have a look at total shooting effeciency. From the table we can see top star of warriors--Durant rank first amnong the starting lineup. Due to his strong physical quality&flexibility,he can easily pass their opponent.Andre Iguodala follow Durant rank 2, but from the chart we can tell he has the lowest FPA which means he can not always made the shoot. Surprisingly, Stephen Curry only rank 4th in this table,but he contribute the most of points of the team. A total 584 field goal rank 1st among all his teammates.

    ## 5 Graymond Green   578   245     0.424

Then let's see the chart of FGA and FG Undoubtly, Stephen Curry again win the first place,followed by Thompson with a slight difference. There are 3 player exceed the average line.

### **2 points shooting effeciency**

There isn't a big change in the rank, but Iguadala exceed Durant by 3%, with the 63% shooting accuracy rank 1st. The other player has over 60% 2 points shooting accuracy is Durant. With 2.08m height, he can easily make slam dunk.

**2PT Effective Shooting % by Player**

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 4
    ##   name           total  made perc_made
    ##   <chr>          <int> <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Andre Iguodala   210   134     0.638
    ## 2 Kevin Durant     643   390     0.607
    ## 3 Stephen Curry    563   304     0.540

    ## 5 Graymond Green   346   171     0.494

From the barchat we can see Kevin durant rank 1st in both 2 points attempts and 2 points goals, which make him the best 2 points scorer in golden state warriors. Thompason follow Durant rank 2, with 3 less attempts, but as for the shooting efficency, he can not compare with Durant.

### **Three points shooting efficiency**

Finally,we should have a look at the three points shooting efficiency. Talking about 3 points goals, we have to mention the 2 pointing guard in Golden State Warrious--Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry.As the top three points shooter of the league, they will never disappointed us. Both of them have more than 40% goal percentage, and klay Thompson reach 42.4%,which is an amazing number.

Besides, Kevin Durant also has an outstanding performance in 3 points goal, with an 38.6% goal percentage, he deserve title of the most comprehensive player in the league.

**3PT Effective Shooting % by Player**

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 4
    ##   name           total  made perc_made
    ##   <chr>          <int> <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Klay Thompson    580   246     0.424
    ## 2 Stephen Curry    687   280     0.408
    ## 3 Kevin Durant     272   105     0.386
    ## 4 Andre Iguodala   161    58     0.360
    ## 5 Graymond Green   232    74     0.319

Then, from the chart we can see the number of 3 points attempts and goals achieved by each player. Stephen Curry rank 1st and contribute more than 1/3 of the 3 points goals in the team, which prove his value as a shooting guard.Klay Thompson follows him ranks 2nd. However, this time only 2 player pass the average line, which prove the division of duty of Golden State Warriors is clear and the collaboration is excellent. ![](workout01-yumeng-jiang_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)
